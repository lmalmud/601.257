## Game Summary 

A one- or two-paragraph description of your game. If there are important story and/or character aspects, include them here. 

You are a farmer on a frontier world settling the land. However, there are hungry monsters lurking in the shadows waiting to eat your crops and livestock. Get money by farming during the daytime and buying towers to defend your land from the monsters at night. You’ll have to manage your time wisely, fight bravely, and act strategically to ensure the survival of yourself and your crops. 

## Genres 

This will be a tower defense game that is played from the first-person perspective. It will include both strategy (in the tower defense component) and simulation (in the farming aspect) 

Tower defense, first person, farming sim, strategy. 

## Inspiration 

### Rogue Tower 

Rogue Tower is a roguelike tower defense game, where the map is expanded procedurally every wave. Specifically, the inspiration we took from this game comes from the game mode “Touch Grass (April Fools)”, where the game is played in first person. While this game mode was created as a joke in Rogue Tower, it can be pretty fun and is an interesting way to play a tower defense game. 

### Love Death and Robots: Suits 

Suits is an episode from the Netflix show Love Death and Robots, where a group of farmers have mech suits that they pilot to defend their land from alien invaders. The subject matter of our game was inspired by this episode of the show!

### Thronefall 

We really liked the art style of this game, and how bold the colors are. It’s a tower defense game, so some inspiration can also be drawn from the level design and mechanics. The player is a character that roams around in this game, instead of just an omniscient mouse that can place stuff down, so this is a good game to look at for making a tower defense game where the player character is an actual character in the world. 

### Bad North 

 

### Minecraft 

One of our favorite parts of Minecraft was the farming- providing a peaceful, routine activity that is separate from the rest of the gameplay. We are inspired by these mechanics, as well as some of the texture

## Gameplay 

A paragraph or bulleted list describing how the player will interact with the game, and the key gameplay mechanics that you plan to have implemented in your finalized game. Also use this section to broadly describe the expected user interface and game-controls. 

The tower defense is our first priority with the farming aspect a stretch goal. In absence of the farming portion of the game, the player can just get a income over time.  

Day-night cycle 

During the daytime, the player is free from attacking enemies. They can plant crops and build/upgrade towers. 

During the nighttime, the enemies come from certain, set areas (holes in the fence?)  

The path the enemies take is dynamic so the player is able to construct mazes to  

## Development Plan 

### Project Checkpoint 1-2: Basic Mechanics and Scripting (Ch 5-9) 

We first intend to implement the tower defense aspect of our game, layering on the farming components as time progresses. Before we have implemented the farming simulation aspect of the game (which is the mechanism that will enable players to get more and improved resources), we will include automatically allocated resources. This will allow for us to develop our game as though it were a regular tower defense, and later layer in the simulation aspect. 

Our goals for the first few checkpoints will include: 

Player movement 

Basic tower  

Sketch out a rough idea of what parts of your game you will implement for the next submission, Project Checkpoint 1-2: Basic Mechanics and Scripting involving Unity textbook Chapters 5 through 9. You will come back to update this for each submission based on which things you've accomplished and which need to be prioritized next. This will help you practice thinking ahead as well as reflecting on the progress you've made throughout the semester.
